# Project Agent Instructions

## Markdown File Format

After finishing edits to a Markdown file, format only the files that was changed with `markdownlint-cli2`, then run `textlint` to apply typography fixes and terminology replacements.

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix --no-globs path/to/file.md
npx textlint --fix path/to/file.md
```

Avoid running broad auto-fix commands unless the task is specifically to clean up formatting across the repository.

## Folder Structure

Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`. Agent instructions are under `./instructions`.
